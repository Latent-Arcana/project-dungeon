# project-dungeon

_The plight of humanity is that despite all of its efforts to conquer the universe, it cannot help but be a part of it. Even so, it may still be possible for mankind to transcend the confines of its mortality by traveling deeper into that interstitial dream between time and space..._

_The Coil was constructed to serve as the passageway between realities--an escape from a dying world. But it wasn't the answer. Or at least, not to the question being asked._

_You are a cartographer. Many have come before you. Many shall come after. Your number has been called. Step forward into the Looking Glass, and prepare yourself._

_You must map out your crossing. Fail, and you shall be added to the Velvet Record, to be forgotten in a sea of remembrance, doomed to travel within the Coil forever. But, should you succeed, you may ensure the safety of the next travelers who find their way in._

## Information

This is an open-source creative software project made by Latent Arcana. The intent of this project is to entertain and educate. 

This project is still in development. Please feel free to use and reuse the code present in this repository to make your own games. Note that it does rely on the use of Unity and Unity Engine (2022.3.28f). Much of the code can be used outside of Unity however.

Please use at your own risk while this project is in development. When the project is complete it will be updated and this README will explain the required steps to run and manage a project-dungeon instance. You will also be able to download the game on itch.io!
