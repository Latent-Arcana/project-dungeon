_The plight of humanity is that despite all of its efforts to conquer the universe, it cannot help but be a part of it. Even so, it may still be possible for mankind to transcend the confines of its mortality by traveling deeper into that interstitial dream between time and space..._

_The passageway between realities is narrow, fickle, and often filled with dangers beyond our comprehension. But traveling it may be humanity's only hope at escaping its miserable circumstances._

_You are a cartographer. Many have come before you. Many shall come after. Your number has been called. Step forward and prepare yourself._

_You must map out your crossing. Fail, and you shall be added to the Velvet Record, to be forgotten in a sea of remembrance, doomed to travel within the aether forever. But, should you succeed, you may ensure the safety of the next travelers who find their way in._
